Description: The poems package provides a framework of interoperable R6 classes 
    (Chang, 2020, <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6>) for building ensembles 
    of viable models via the pattern-oriented modeling (POM) approach (Grimm et al.,
    2005, <doi:10.1126/science.1116681>). The package includes classes for 
    encapsulating and generating model parameters, and managing the POM workflow. 
    The workflow includes: model setup; generating model parameters via Latin 
    hyper-cube sampling (Iman & Conover, 1980, <doi:10.1080/03610928008827996>); 
    running multiple sampled model simulations; collating summary results; and 
    validating and selecting an ensemble of models that best match known patterns. 
    By default, model validation and selection utilizes an approximate Bayesian 
    computation (ABC) approach (Beaumont et al., 2002, 
    <doi:10.1093/genetics/162.4.2025>), although alternative user-defined 
    functionality could be employed. The package includes a spatially explicit 
    demographic population model simulation engine, which incorporates default 
    functionality for density dependence, correlated environmental stochasticity, 
    stage-based transitions, and distance-based dispersal. The user may customize
    the simulator by defining functionality for translocations, harvesting, 
    mortality, and other processes, as well as defining the sequence order for the 
    simulator processes. The framework could also be adapted for use with other 
    model simulators by utilizing its extendable (inheritable) base classes.
