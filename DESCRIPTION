Title: Pattern-Oriented Ensemble Modeling and Simulation
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Global ChEC Lab
Maintainer: Sean Haythorne <sean.haythorne@adelaide.edu.au>
Description: The poems package provides a framework of interoperable R6 classes for 
    building ensembles of viable models via the pattern-oriented modeling (POM) 
    approach. The package includes classes for encapsulating and generating model 
    parameters, and managing the POM workflow. The workflow includes: model setup; 
    generating model parameters via Latin hypercube sampling; running multiple sampled
    model simulations; collating summary results; and validating and selecting an 
    ensemble of models that best match known patterns. By default, model validation and 
    selection utilizes an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, although 
    alternative user-defined functionality could be employed. The package also includes 
    a customizable spatially explicit demographic population model simulation engine, 
    which includes default functionality for density dependence, correlated 
    environmental stochasiticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based dispersal.
    The user may also define functionality for translocations, harvesting, mortality, 
    and other processes, as well as define the sequence order for the simulator 
    processes. The framework could also be adapted for use with other model simulators 
    by utilizing its extendable (inheritable) base classes.
