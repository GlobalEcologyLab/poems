Description: The poems package provides a framework of interoperable R6 classes for 
    building ensembles of viable models via the pattern-oriented modeling (POM) 
    approach. The package includes classes for encapsulating and generating model 
    parameters, and managing the POM workflow. The workflow includes: model setup; 
    generating model parameters via Latin hyper-cube sampling; running multiple sampled
    model simulations; collating summary results; and validating and selecting an 
    ensemble of models that best match known patterns. By default, model validation and 
    selection utilizes an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, although 
    alternative user-defined functionality could be employed. The package includes 
    a spatially explicit demographic population model simulation engine, which 
    incorporates default functionality for density dependence, correlated environmental 
    stochasticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based dispersal. The user may 
    customize the simulator by defining functionality for translocations, harvesting, 
    mortality, and other processes, as well as defining the sequence order for the 
    simulator processes. The framework could also be adapted for use with other model
    simulators by utilizing its extendable (inheritable) base classes.
