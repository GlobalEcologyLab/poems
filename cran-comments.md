## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the "+ file LICENSE" reference and the file which is part of
R anyway.

* There is no reference about the method at this stage. We intend to publish a 
software note, which we can add in the Description
field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....> later. Thanks.

## Test environments
* win-builder (devel and release)
* local OS X (10.12.6) install, R 3.6.2

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE (on win-builder only):

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Sean Haythorne <sean.haythorne@adelaide.edu.au>'
